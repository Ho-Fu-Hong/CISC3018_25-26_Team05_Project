# CISC3018-Team05-Project
Integrated Cloud-Based Weather &amp; Crop Yield Prediction System Using Apache Spark <br>
<br>
Introduction <br>
Crops are fundamental source of food for human populations that forms the backbone of global food security and agricultural economies. However, climate change has intensified extreme weather events’ frequency and has led to unpredictable agricultural yields.  <br>
This project proposes a cloud-based big data yield forecasting system designed to improve the accuracy and usability of agricultural forecasting. The system combines historical crop yield datasets with meteorological information and processes them through a robust and scalable architecture with the use of Ubuntu VM, Jupyter Notebook, Apache Spark, HDFS and LAMP.
